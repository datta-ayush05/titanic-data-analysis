# Titanic Survival Analysis ðŸš¢

This is my first data analysis project using Python and pandas, based on the Titanic dataset.

## ðŸ“¦ What Iâ€™ve Done So Far

- Data cleaning and missing value handling
- Feature engineering (Title extraction, IsAlone feature)
- Used `map()`, `apply()`, and lambda functions
- Explored groupby analysis

## ðŸ“ˆ My Learning Curve

- **Week 1**: Basics of pandas, dataset loading, exploring with `head()`, `info()`, etc.
- **Week 2**: Custom functions, `map()`, `apply()`, and string operations
- **Week 3**: Plan to explore basic ML models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees)

This repo is a live log of my initial research and application of useful python libraries and modules in data interpretation
